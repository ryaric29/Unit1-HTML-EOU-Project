            riding my bike.</p>

            <p>In baseball, I play second base and outfield. I enjoy baseball because I get to have fun with my friends.

            <h3>How my Interests Connect To CS</h3>
            <p>My interests connect back to computer science for multiple reasons.
                Firstly, the sports I play will teach me teamwork and give me the determination I will need to succeed
                in this field. Secondly, frequently riding a bike can help me concentrate and allow me to later focus on
                my projects.
